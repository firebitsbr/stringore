Description: The 'Onigmo' regular expression 'C' libary <https://github.com/k-takata/Onigmo> --
    which is an extension of the 'Onigmura' <https://github.com/kkos/oniguruma> library --
    provides support for a wide array of regular expression types and works across a 
    wide array of character encodings. Methods are provided to perform searching, matching
    and extraction in a tidy (i.e. "data first") manner.
